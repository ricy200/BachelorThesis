# BachelorThesis
Code for my Bachelor Thesis: "A Comparison of LLM and Human Generated Archival Data by Using Word Embeddings".
To run the code, the files 'Text_Human.txt' and 'Text_LLM.txt' need to be downloaded.
The Notebook Login in the Code is not necessary for the big LLM 'Hermes-2-Theta-Llama-3-70B', but it can be necessary when using other models (e.g. 'Llama-3.1-8B')
